	abstract = {We introduce a new architecture called a conditional invertible neural network (cINN), and use it to address the task of diverse image-to-image translation for natural images. This is not easily possible with existing INN models due to some fundamental limitations. The cINN combines the purely generative INN model with an unconstrained feed-forward network, which efficiently preprocesses the conditioning image into maximally informative features. All parameters of a cINN are jointly optimized with a stable, maximum likelihood-based training procedure. Even though INN-based models have received far less attention in the literature than GANs, they have been shown to have some remarkable properties absent in GANs, e.g. apparent immunity to mode collapse. We find that our cINNs leverage these properties for image-to-image translation, demonstrated on day to night translation and image colorization. Furthermore, we take advantage of our bidirectional cINN architecture to explore and manipulate emergent properties of the latent space, such as changing the image style in an intuitive way.},

	abstract = {Aims: We introduce a new deep-learning approach for the reconstruction of 3D dust density and temperature distributions from multi-wavelength dust emission observations on the scale of individual star-forming cloud cores ({\textless}0.2pc). Methods: We construct a training data set by processing cloud cores from the Cloud Factory simulations with the POLARIS radiative transfer code to produce synthetic dust emission observations at 23 wavelengths between 12 and 1300 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m. We simplify the task by reconstructing the cloud structure along individual lines of sight and train a conditional invertible neural network (cINN) for this purpose. The cINN belongs to the group of normalising flow methods and is able to predict full posterior distributions for the target dust properties. We test different cINN setups, ranging from a scenario that includes all 23 wavelengths down to a more realistically limited case with observations at only seven wavelengths. We evaluate the predictive performance of these models on synthetic test data. Results: We report an excellent reconstruction performance for the 23-wavelengths cINN model, achieving median absolute relative errors of about 1.8\% in \${\textbackslash}log(n/m{\textasciicircum}\{-3\})\$ and 1\% in \${\textbackslash}log(T\_\{dust\}/K)\$, respectively. We identify trends towards overestimation at the low end of the density range and towards underestimation at the high end of both the density and temperature values, which may be related to a bias in the training data. Limiting our coverage to a combination of only seven wavelengths, we still find a satisfactory performance with average absolute relative errors of about 3.3\% and 2.5\% in \${\textbackslash}log(n/m{\textasciicircum}\{-3\})\$ and \${\textbackslash}log(T\_\{dust\}/K)\$. Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study shows that the cINN-based approach for 3D reconstruction of dust density and temperature is very promising and even compatible with a more realistically constrained wavelength coverage.},

The size spectrum is in agreement with a power law of the form \{dN/ dr\}{\textasciitilde} r(-3.0) .

	abstract = {Modeling the chemistry of molecular clouds is critical to accurately simulating their evolution. To reduce computational cost, 3D simulations generally restrict their chemistry to species with strong heating and cooling effects. Time-dependent information about the evolution of other species is therefore often neglected. We address this gap by post-processing tracer particles in the SILCC-Zoom molecular cloud simulations. Using a chemical network of 39 species and 301 reactions (including freeze-out of CO and H\$\_\{2\}\$O), and a novel algorithm to reconstruct a density grid from sparse tracer particle data, we produce time-dependent density distributions for various species. We focus upon the evolution of HCO\${\textasciicircum}\{+\}\$, which is a critical formation reactant of CO but is not typically modeled on-the-fly. We find that \${\textbackslash}sim90\$\% of the HCO\${\textasciicircum}\{+\}\$ content of the cold molecular gas forms in situ around \$n\_{\textbackslash}textrm\{\{HCO\${\textasciicircum}+\$\}\}{\textbackslash}simeq10{\textasciicircum}3\$-\$10{\textasciicircum}4\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$, over a time-scale of approximately 1 Myr. The remaining \${\textbackslash}sim10\$\% forms at high extinction sites, with minimal turbulent mixing out into the less dense gas. We further show that the dominant HCO\${\textasciicircum}\{+\}\$ formation pathway is dependent on the visual extinction, with the reaction H\$\_\{3\}{\textasciicircum}\{+\}\$ + CO contributing 90\% of the total HCO\${\textasciicircum}\{+\}\$ production above \$A\_{\textbackslash}textrm\{V,3D\}=3\$. We produce the very first maps of the HCO\${\textasciicircum}\{+\}\$ column density, \$N\$(HCO\${\textasciicircum}\{+\}\$), and show that it reaches values as high as \$10{\textasciicircum}\{15\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$. We find that 50\% of the HCO\${\textasciicircum}+\$ mass is located within \$A\_{\textbackslash}textrm\{V\}{\textbackslash}sim10\$-30, in a density range of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{3.5\}\$-\$10{\textasciicircum}\{4.5\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$. Our maps of \$N\$(HCO\${\textasciicircum}\{+\}\$) are shown to be in good agreement with recent observations of the W49A star-forming region.},

	abstract = {The physical properties of molecular clouds are often measured using spectral-line observations, which provide the only probes of the clouds' velocity structure. It is hard, though, to assess whether and to what extent intensity features in position-position-velocity (PPV) space correspond to "real" density structures in position-position-position (PPP) space. In this paper, we create synthetic molecular cloud spectral-line maps of simulated molecular clouds, and present a new technique for measuring the reality of individual PPV structures. Our procedure projects density structures identified in PPP space into corresponding intensity structures in PPV space and then measures the geometric overlap of the projected structures with structures identified from the synthetic observation. The fractional overlap between a PPP and PPV structure quantifies how well the synthetic observation recovers information about the 3D structure. Applying this machinery to a set of synthetic observations of CO isotopes, we measure how well spectral-line measurements recover mass, size, velocity dispersion, and virial parameter for a simulated star-forming region. By disabling various steps of our analysis, we investigate how much opacity, chemistry, and gravity affect measurements of physical properties extracted from PPV cubes. For the simulations used here, our results suggest that superposition induces a {\textasciitilde}40\% uncertainty in masses, sizes, and velocity dispersions derived from 13CO. The virial parameter is most affected by superposition, such that estimates of the virial parameter derived from PPV and PPP information typically disagree by a factor of {\textasciitilde}2. This uncertainty makes it particularly difficult to judge whether gravitational or kinetic energy dominate a given region, since the majority of virial parameter measurements fall within a factor of 2 of the equipartition level alpha {\textasciitilde} 2.},

	abstract = {U-Net has become a cornerstone in various visual applications such as image segmentation and diffusion probability models. While numerous innovative designs and improvements have been introduced by incorporating transformers or MLPs, the networks are still limited to linearly modeling patterns as well as the deficient interpretability. To address these challenges, our intuition is inspired by the impressive results of the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in terms of accuracy and interpretability, which reshape the neural network learning via the stack of non-linear learnable activation functions derived from the Kolmogorov-Anold representation theorem. Specifically, in this paper, we explore the untapped potential of KANs in improving backbones for vision tasks. We investigate, modify and re-design the established U-Net pipeline by integrating the dedicated KAN layers on the tokenized intermediate representation, termed U-KAN. Rigorous medical image segmentation benchmarks verify the superiority of U-KAN by higher accuracy even with less computation cost. We further delved into the potential of U-KAN as an alternative U-Net noise predictor in diffusion models, demonstrating its applicability in generating task-oriented model architectures. These endeavours unveil valuable insights and sheds light on the prospect that with U-KAN, you can make strong backbone for medical image segmentation and generation.

In this work we compare the orientations of filamentary structures in the Polaris Flare, as seen through dust emission by Herschel, to the plane-of-the-sky magnetic field orientation (\${\textbackslash}rm B\_\{pos\}\$) as revealed by stellar optical polarimetry with RoboPol. Dust structures in this translucent cloud show a strong preference for alignment with \${\textbackslash}rm B\_\{pos\}\$. 70 \% of field orientations are consistent with those of the filaments (within 30\${\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$). We explore the spatial variation of the relative orientations and find it to be uncorrelated with the dust emission intensity and correlated to the dispersion of polarization angles. Concentrating in the area around the highest column density filament, and in the region with the most uniform field, we infer the \${\textbackslash}rm B\_\{pos\}\$ strength to be 24 \$-\$ 120 \$μ\$G. Assuming that the magnetic field can be decomposed into a turbulent and an ordered component, we find a turbulent-to-ordered ratio of 0.2 \$-\$ 0.8, implying that the magnetic field is dynamically important, at least in these two areas. We discuss implications on the 3D field properties, as well as on the distance estimate of the cloud.},

	abstract = {We introduce the state-of-the-art deep learning Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a method to infer the volume or number density of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) from projected mass surface density maps. We adopt magnetohydrodynamic simulations with different global magnetic field strengths and large-scale dynamics, i.e., noncolliding and colliding GMCs. We train a diffusion model on both mass surface density maps and their corresponding mass-weighted number density maps from different viewing angles for all the simulations. We compare the diffusion model performance with a more traditional empirical two-component and three-component power-law fitting method and with a more traditional neural network machine learning approach (CASI-2D). We conclude that the diffusion model achieves an order of magnitude improvement on the accuracy of predicting number density compared to that by other methods. We apply the diffusion method to some example astronomical column density maps of Taurus and the Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) G28.37+0.07 and G35.39-0.33 to produce maps of their mean volume densities.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

As an effective way to improve the sufficiency and diversity of training data, data augmentation has become a necessary part of successful application of deep learning models on image data. In this paper, we systematically review different image data augmentation methods. We propose a taxonomy of reviewed methods and present the strengths and limitations of these methods. We also conduct extensive experiments with various data augmentation methods on three typical computer vision tasks, including semantic segmentation, image classification and object detection. Finally, we discuss current challenges faced by data augmentation and future research directions to put forward some useful research guidance.},

The proposed Attention U-Net architecture is evaluated on two large CT abdominal datasets for multi-class image segmentation.

KANs have no linear weights at all -- every weight parameter is replaced by a univariate function parametrized as a spline. We show that this seemingly simple change makes KANs outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and interpretability. For accuracy, much smaller KANs can achieve comparable or better accuracy than much larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE solving. Theoretically and empirically, KANs possess faster neural scaling laws than MLPs. For interpretability, KANs can be intuitively visualized and can easily interact with human users. Through two examples in mathematics and physics, KANs are shown to be useful collaborators helping scientists (re)discover mathematical and physical laws. In summary, KANs are promising alternatives for MLPs, opening opportunities for further improving today's deep learning models which rely heavily on MLPs.},

	abstract = {Context.
              The connection between the prestellar core mass function (CMF) and the stellar initial mass function (IMF) lies at the heart of all star formation theories, but it is inherently observationally unreachable.
            
            
              Aims.
              In this paper we aim to elucidate the earliest phases of star formation with a series of high-resolution numerical simulations that include the formation of sinks from high-density clumps. In particular, we focus on the transition from cores to sink particles within a massive molecular filament, and work towards identifying the factors that determine the shape of the CMF and the IMF.
            
            
              Methods.
              We have compared the CMF and IMF between magnetized and unmagnetized simulations, and between different resolutions. In order to study the effect of core stability, we applied different selection criteria according to the virial parameter and the mass-to-flux ratio of the cores.
            
            
              Results.
              We find that, in all models, selecting cores based on their kinematic virial parameter tends to exclude collapsing objects, because they host high velocity dispersions. Selecting only the thermally unstable magnetized cores, we observe that their mass-to-flux ratio spans almost two orders of magnitude for a given mass. We also see that, when magnetic fields are included, the CMF peaks at higher core mass values with respect to a pure hydrodynamical simulation. Nonetheless, all models produce sink mass functions with a high-mass slope consistent with Salpeter. Finally, we examined the effects of resolution and find that, in these isothermal simulations, even models with very high dynamical range fail to converge in the mass function.
            
            
              Conclusions.
              Our main conclusion is that, although the resulting CMFs and IMFs have similar slopes in all simulations, the cores have slightly different sizes and kinematical properties when a magnetic field is included, and this affects their gravitational stability. Nonetheless, a core selection based on the mass-to-flux ratio is not enough to alter the shape of the CMF, if we do not take thermal stability into account. Finally, we conclude that extreme care should be given to resolution issues when studying sink formation with an isothermal equation of state, since with each increase in resolution, fragmentation continues to smaller scales in a self-similar way.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images in remote sensing image processing still faces challenges, primarily due to their complexity and multimodal characteristics. Diffusion models, known for their stable training process and exceptional image generation capabilities, have shown good application potential in this field. However, when dealing with multimodal data, it may prove challenging for the models to fully capture the intricate relationships between the modalities, which may result in incomplete information integration and a small amount of remaining noise in the generated images. To address these problems, we propose a new model, KanDiff, for hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion. To address the differences in modal information between multispectral and hyperspectral images, KANDiff incorporates Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KAN) to guide the inputs. It helps the model understand the complex relationships between the modalities by replacing the fixed activation function in the traditional MLP with a learnable activation function. Furthermore, the image generated by the diffusion model may exhibit a small amount of the remaining noise. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) effectively extract local features through their convolutional layers and achieve noise suppression via layer-by-layer feature representation. Therefore, the MergeCNN module is further introduced to enhance the fusion effect, resulting in smoother and more accurate outcomes. Experimental results on the public CAVE and Harvard datasets indicate that KanDiff has achieved improvements over current high-performance methods across several metrics, particularly showing significant enhancements in the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and the structural similarity index measure (SSIM), thus demonstrating superior performance. Additionally, we have created an image fusion dataset of the lunar surface, and KANDiff exhibits robust performance on this dataset as well. This work introduces an effective solution for addressing the challenges posed by missing high-resolution hyperspectral images (HRHS) data, which is essential for tasks including landing site selection and resource exploration within the realm of deep space exploration.},

We solve the equations of hydrodynamics on grids with up to 1024{\textasciicircum}3 cells for purely solenoidal and purely compressive forcing. Eleven lower-resolution models with mixtures of both forcings are also analysed. We find velocity dispersion--size relations consistent with observations and independent numerical simulations, irrespective of the type of forcing. However, compressive forcing yields stronger turbulent compression at the same RMS Mach number than solenoidal forcing, resulting in a three times larger standard deviation of volumetric and column density probability distributions (PDFs). We conclude that the strong dependence of the density PDF on the type of forcing must be taken into account in any theory using the PDF to predict properties of star formation. We supply a quantitative description of this dependence. We find that different observed regions show evidence of different mixtures of compressive and solenoidal forcing, with more compressive forcing occurring primarily in swept-up shells.},

	abstract = {Star formation is a complex multi-scale phenomenon that is of significant importance for astrophysics in general. Stars and star formation are key pillars in observational astronomy from local star forming regions in the Milky Way up to high-redshift galaxies. From a theoretical perspective, star formation and feedback processes (radiation, winds, and supernovae) play a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of the physical processes at work, both individually and of their interactions. In this review we will give an overview of the main processes that are important for the understanding of star formation. We start with an observationally motivated view on star formation from a global perspective and outline the general paradigm of the life-cycle of molecular clouds, in which star formation is the key process to close the cycle. After that we focus on the thermal and chemical aspects in star forming regions, discuss turbulence and magnetic fields as well as gravitational forces. Finally, we review the most important stellar feedback mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Stars are among the most fundamental structures of our Universe. They comprise most of the baryonic and luminous mass of galaxies; synthesize heavy elements; and inject mass, momentum, and energy into the interstellar medium. They are also home to the planets. Because stellar properties are primarily decided by their mass, the so-called stellar initial mass function (IMF) is critical to the structuring of our Universe. We review the various physical processes and theories that have been put forward as well as the numerical simulations that have been carried out to explain the origin of the stellar IMF. Key messages from this review include the following:
▪Gravity and turbulence most likely determine the power-law, high-mass part of the IMF.▪Depending of the Mach number and the density distribution, several regimes are possible, including ΓIMF ≃ 0, −0.8, −1, or −1.3, where dN/d log M ∝ M
                        ΓIMF
                        . These regimes are likely universal; however, the transition between these regimes is not.▪Protostellar jets can play a regulating influence on the IMF by injecting momentum into collapsing clumps and unbinding gas.▪The peak of the IMF may be a consequence of dust opacity and molecular hydrogen physics at the origin of the first hydrostatic core. This depends weakly on large-scale environmental conditions such as radiation, magnetic field, turbulence, or metallicity. This likely constitutes one reason for the relative universality of the IMF.},

              Describing how the properties of the interstellar medium are combined across various size scales is crucial for understanding star formation scaling laws and connecting Galactic and extragalactic data of molecular clouds.
            
            
              Aims.
              We describe how the statistical structure of the clouds and its connection to star formation changes from sub-parsec to kiloparsec scales in a complete region within the Milky Way disk.
            
            
              Methods.
              We built a census of molecular clouds within 2 kpc from the Sun using data from the literature. We examined the dust-based column density probability distributions (N-PDFs) of the clouds and their relation to star formation as traced by young stellar objects (YSOs). We then examined our survey region from the outside, within apertures of varying sizes, and describe how the N-PDFs and their relation to star formation changes with the size scale.
            
            
              Results.
              We present a census of the molecular clouds within 2 kpc distance, including 72 clouds and YSO counts for 44 of them. The N-PDFs of the clouds are not well described by any single simple model; use of any single model may bias the interpretation of the N-PDFs. The top-heaviness of the N-PDFs correlates with star formation activity, and the correlation changes with Galactic environment (spiral- and inter-arm regions). We find that the density contrast of clouds may be more intimately linked to star formation than the dense gas mass fraction. The aperture-averaged N-PDFs vary with the size scale and are more top-heavy for larger apertures. The top-heaviness of the aperture N-PDFs correlates with star formation activity up to roughly 0.5 kpc, depending on the environment. Our results suggest that the relations between cloud structure and star formation are environment specific and best captured by relative quantities (e.g. the density contrast). Finally, we show that the density structures of individual clouds give rise to a kiloparsec-scale Kennicutt-Schmidt relation as a combination of sampling effects and blending of different galactic environments.},

              Stars form in supersonic turbulent molecular clouds that are self-gravitating. We present an analytic determination of the star formation rate (SFR) in a gravoturbulent medium based on the density probability distribution function of molecular clouds having a piecewise lognormal (LN)
              and
              power-law (PL) form. This is in contrast to previous analytic SFR models that are governed primarily by interstellar turbulence, which sets purely LN density probability distribution functions (PDFs). In the gravoturbulent SFR model described herein, low-density gas resides in the LN portion of the PDF. Gas becomes gravitationally unstable past a critical density (
              ρ
              crit
              ), and the PDF begins to form a PL. As the collapse of the cloud proceeds, the transitional density (
              ρ
              
                t
              
              ) between the LN and PL portions of the PDF moves toward lower density while the slope of the PL (
              α
              ) becomes increasingly shallow. The SFR per free-fall time is calculated via an integral over the LN from
              ρ

              to

                t
              
              to the maximum density. As
              α
              becomes shallower, the SFR accelerates beyond the expected values calculated from an LN density PDF. We show that the star formation efficiency per free-fall time in observations of local molecular clouds increases with shallower PDF PL slopes, in agreement with our model. Our model can explain why star formation is spatially and temporally variable within a cloud and why the depletion times observed in local and extragalactic giant molecular clouds vary. Both star-bursting and quiescent star-forming systems can be explained without the need to invoke extreme variations of turbulence in the local interstellar environment.},

              We analytically calculate the star formation efficiency and dense self-gravitating gas fraction in the presence of magneto-gravo-turbulence using the model of Burkhart, which employs a piecewise lognormal
              and
              powerlaw density probability distribution function (PDF). We show that the PDF transition density from lognormal to powerlaw forms is a mathematically motivated critical density for star formation and can be physically related to the density where the Jeans length is comparable to the sonic length, i.e., the post-shock critical density for collapse. When the PDF transition density is taken as the critical density, the instantaneous star formation efficiency (

We test the analytic predictions for the transition density and self-gravitating gas fraction against AREPO moving mesh gravo-turbulent simulations and find good agreement. We predict that, when gravity dominates the density distribution in the star-forming gas, the star formation efficiency should be weakly anti-correlated with the sonic Mach number while the depletion time should increase with increasing sonic Mach number. The star formation efficiency and depletion time depend primarily on the dense self-gravitating gas fraction, which in turn depends on the interplay of gravity, turbulence, and stellar feedback. Our model prediction is in agreement with recent observations, such as the M51 PdBI Arcsecond Whirlpool Survey.},

	abstract = {A purely statistical origin of hierarchical density structure in pressureless and nearly pressureless turbulent flows without self-gravity is proposed. It is argued that hydrodynamic (Navier-Stokes) flows with rms Mach numbers Mrms ≫ 1, like the cold interstellar medium or some cosmological flows, have a nearly pressureless behavior, except perhaps in a small fraction of the volume. Assuming that in these flows the density field can be considered as a random variable in time with an associated probability distribution function (pdf), a condition on the pdf for the spontaneous development of hierarchical structure is proposed. The condition is essentially a requirement that the joint probability of a succession of n constructively interfering relative density fluctuations of amplitude a be larger than the probability of a single, large fluctuation of the same final amplitude a . An analytic form for this condition is derived, under the assumption that the density pdf is scale- invariant, and three important functional forms of the pdf (a power-law, a lognormal, and an exponential distribution) are tested according to this criterion. It is found that development of hierarchical structure should always be expected for the lognormal and exponential distributions at large values of n and/or a, but is parameter-dependent in the case of the power law. The assumption of a scale-invariant density pdf is motivated (but not rigorously proved) by the scale invariance of the pressureless hydrodynamic equations with negligible self-gravity, and a numerical simulation of a compressible turbulent flow in two dimensions in a transonic regime (M ∼ 1) is used to test this and other secondary assumptions. The density field developed by the simulation clearly exhibits at least three levels of hierarchical nesting. The density statistics, albeit obscured by the limited resolution, which limits the feasible density contrasts, are shown to be consistent with the hypotheses. A discussion on the degree to which the dynamics of two- and three-dimensional flows may differ from one another in the compressible case is given. Finally, a remark is made that the hierarchical structure produced by this mechanism in turbulent compressible flows is transient although statistically stationary. This should be the case of all non-self-gravitating clouds in the cold interstellar medium and of small-scale structures in cosmological flows.},

We aim at estimating the volume density distribution in nearby molecular clouds, to measure the relation between column and volume densities and to determine their roles as predictors of star formation. We develop an inverse modelling method to estimate the volume density distributions of molecular clouds. We apply this method to 24 nearby molecular clouds for which column densities have been derived using Herschel observations and for which star formation efficiencies (SFE) have been derived using observations with the Spitzer space telescope. We then compare the relationships of several column- and volume-density based descriptors of dense gas with the SFE of the clouds. We derive volume density distributions for 24 nearby molecular clouds, which represents the most complete sample of such distributions to date. The relationship between column densities and peak volume densities in these clouds is a piece-wise power-law relation that changes its slope at a column density of \$5-10{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{22\}\$ H\$\_2\$cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$. We interpret this as a signature of hierarchical fragmentation in the dense ISM. We find that the volume-density based dense gas fraction is the best predictor of star formation in the clouds, and in particular, it is as anticipated a better predictor than the column-density based dense gas fraction. We also derive a volume density threshold density for star formation of \$2{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}4\$ H\$\_2\$cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$.},

	abstract = {Constraining the physical and chemical evolution of molecular clouds is essential to our understanding of star formation. These investigations often necessitate knowledge of some local representative number density of the gas along the line of sight. However, constraining the number density is a difficult endeavor. Robust constraints of the number density often require line observations of specific molecules along with radiation transfer modeling, which provides densities traced by that specific molecule. Column density maps of molecular clouds are more readily available, with many high-fidelity maps calculated from dust emission and extinction, in particular from surveys conducted with the Herschel Space Observatory. We introduce a new probabilistic model which is based on the assumption that the total hydrogen nuclei column density along a line of sight can be decomposed into a turbulent component and a gravitationally-dominated component. Therefore, for each pixel in a column density map, the line of sight is decomposed into characteristic diffuse (dubbed ``turbulent'') and dense (dubbed ``gravitational'') gas number densities from column density maps. The method thus exploits a physical model of turbulence to decouple the random turbulent column from gas in dense bound structures empirically using the observed column density maps. We find the model produces reasonable turbulent and gravitational densities in the Taurus L1495/B213 and Polaris Flare clouds. The model can also be used to infer an effective attenuating column density into the cloud, which is useful for astrochemical models of the clouds. We conclude by demonstrating an application of this method by predicting the emission of the [C II], [C I], and CO (J = 1-0) lines across the Taurus L1495/B213 region at the native resolution of the column density map utilizing a grid of photodissociation-region models.},

Méthode pour obtenir la densité n d’un nuage moléculaire via la densité de colonne N.

La méthode s’appuie sur la N-PDF et l’utilise pour séparer en 2 composantes: turbulence \& grav la densité.

Avantages: 


composantes grav \& turbulentes découplées


peut approximer une densité de colonne effective


méthode rapide à utiliser \& interprétation physique “facile”



Limites:


hypothèses sur la température du gas (+ isotherme)


mais aussi sur l’épaisseur du nuage


ou encore des propriétés globales de la turbulence (compressive, div free…)


Fit de la N-PDF (paramètres A, b)


Compliqué si il y a plusieurs structures liées dans la ligne de visée


Compliqué si il y a d’autres processus à l’oeuvre: champ magnétique, pression radia

Orion is discussed in the larger context of star formation in the Solar vicinity over the last 100 Myr. The Orion complex is located on the far side of the Gould's Belt system of clouds and young stars throughwhich our Solar systemis drifting. A review is given of the overall structure and properties of the Orion star forming complex, the best studied OB association. Over the last 12 Myr, Orion has given birth to at least ten thousand stars contained in a half dozen sub-groups and short-lived clusters. The Orion OB association has been the source of several massive, high-velocity run-away stars, including mu-Columbae and AE Aurigae. Some of Orion's most massive members died in supernova explosions that created the 300 pc diameter Orion / Eridanus super-bubble whose near wall may be as close as 180 pc. The combined effects of UV radiation, stellar winds, and supernovae have impacted surviving molecular clouds in Orion. The large Orion A, IC 2118 molecular clouds and dozens of smaller clouds strewn throughout the interior of the superbubble have cometary shapes pointing back towards the center of the Orion OB association. Most are forming stars in the compressed layers facing the bubble interior.},

The image of the cloud in each velocity channel includes {\textasciitilde} 3 million Nyquist sampled pixels on a 20" grid. The high sensitivity and large linear dynamic range of the maps in both isotopologues reveal a very complex, highly structured cloud morphology. There are large scale correlated structures evident in 13CO emission having very fine dimensions, including filaments, cavities, and rings. The 12CO emission shows a quite different structure, with particularly complex interfaces between regions of greater and smaller column density defining the boundaries of the largest-scale cloud structures. The axes of the striations seen in the 12CO emission from relatively diffuse gas are aligned with the direction of the magnetic field. Using a column density-dependent model for the CO fractional abundance, we derive the mass of the region mapped to be 24,000 solar masses, a factor of three greater than would be obtained with canonical CO abundance restricted to the high column density regions. We determine that half the mass of the cloud is in regions having column density below 2.1x10{\textasciicircum}\{21\} per square cm. The distribution of young stars in the region covered is highly nonuniform, with the probability of finding a star in a pixel with a specified column density rising sharply for N(H2) = 6x10{\textasciicircum}\{21\} cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}. We determine a relatively low star formation efficiency (mass of young stars/mass of molecular gas), between 0.3 and 1.2 \%, and an average star formation rate during the past 3 Myr of 8x10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\} stars yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}.},

              CO isotopologue transitions are routinely observed in molecular clouds for the purpose of probing the column density of the gas and the elemental ratios of carbon and oxygen, in addition to tracing the kinematics of the environment.
            
            
              Aims.
              Our study is aimed at estimating the abundances, excitation temperatures, velocity field, and velocity dispersions of the three main CO isotopologues towards a subset of the Orion B molecular cloud, which includes IC 434, NGC 2023, and the Horsehead pillar.
            
            
              Methods.
              We used the Cramer Rao bound (CRB) technique to analyze and estimate the precision of the physical parameters in the framework of local-thermodynamic-equilibrium (LTE) excitation and radiative transfer with added white Gaussian noise. We propose a maximum likelihood estimator to infer the physical conditions from the 1–0 and 2–1 transitions of CO isotopologues. Simulations show that this estimator is unbiased and proves efficient for a common range of excitation temperatures and column densities (

              Results.
              Contrary to general assumptions, the various CO isotopologues have distinct excitation temperatures and the line intensity ratios between different isotopologues do not accurately reflect the column density ratios. We find mean fractional abundances that are consistent with previous determinations towards other molecular clouds. However, significant local deviations are inferred, not only in regions exposed to the UV radiation field, but also in shielded regions. These deviations result from the competition between selective photodissociation, chemical fractionation, and depletion on grain surfaces. We observe that the velocity dispersion of the C
              18
              O emission is 10\% smaller than that of
              13
              CO. The substantial gain resulting from the simultaneous analysis of two different rotational transitions of the same species is rigorously quantified.
            
            
              Conclusions.
              The CRB technique is a promising avenue for analyzing the estimation of physical parameters from the fit of spectral lines. Future works will generalize its application to non-LTE excitation and radiative transfer methods.},

              The availability of large bandwidth receivers for millimeter radio telescopes allows for the acquisition of position-position-frequency data cubes over a wide field of view and a broad frequency coverage. These cubes contain a lot of information on the physical, chemical, and kinematical properties of the emitting gas. However, their large size coupled with an inhomogenous signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) are major challenges for consistent analysis and interpretation.
            
            
              Aims.
              We searched for a denoising method of the low S/N regions of the studied data cubes that would allow the low S/N emission to be recovered without distorting the signals with a high S/N.
            
            
              Methods.
              We performed an in-depth data analysis of the
              13
              CO and C
              17
              O (1–0) data cubes obtained as part of the ORION-B large program performed at the IRAM 30 m telescope. We analyzed the statistical properties of the noise and the evolution of the correlation of the signal in a given frequency channel with that of the adjacent channels. This has allowed us to propose significant improvements of typical autoassociative neural networks, often used to denoise hyperspectral Earth remote sensing data. Applying this method to the
              13
              CO (1–0) cube, we were able to compare the denoised data with those derived with the multiple Gaussian fitting algorithm ROHSA, considered as the state-of-the-art procedure for data line cubes.
            
            
              Results.
              The nature of astronomical spectral data cubes is distinct from that of the hyperspectral data usually studied in the Earth remote sensing literature because the observed intensities become statistically independent beyond a short channel separation. This lack of redundancy in data has led us to adapt the method, notably by taking into account the sparsity of the signal along the spectral axis. The application of the proposed algorithm leads to an increase in the S/N in voxels with a weak signal, while preserving the spectral shape of the data in high S/N voxels.
            
            
              Conclusions.
              The proposed algorithm that combines a detailed analysis of the noise statistics with an innovative autoencoder architecture is a promising path to denoise radio-astronomy line data cubes. In the future, exploring whether a better use of the spatial correlations of the noise may further improve the denoising performances seems to be a promising avenue. In addition, dealing with the multiplicative noise associated with the calibration uncertainty at high S/N would also be beneficial for such large data cubes.},

	abstract = {Reconstructing 3D distributions from their 2D projections is a ubiquitous problem in various scientific fields, particularly so in observational astronomy. In this work, we present a new approach to solving this problem: a Vienna inverse-Abel-transform based object reconstruction algorithm AVIATOR. The reconstruction that it performs is based on the assumption that the distribution along the line of sight is similar to the distribution in the plane of projection, which requires a morphological analysis of the structures in the projected image. The output of the AVIATOR algorithm is an estimate of the 3D distribution in the form of a reconstruction volume that is calculated without the problematic requirements that commonly occur in other reconstruction methods such as symmetry in the plane of projection or modelling of radial profiles. We demonstrate the robustness of the technique to different geometries, density profiles, and noise by applying the AVIATOR algorithm to several model objects. In addition, the algorithm is applied to real data: We reconstruct the density and temperature distributions of two dense molecular cloud cores and find that they are in excellent agreement with profiles reported in the literature. The AVIATOR algorithm is thus capable of reconstructing 3D distributions of physical quantities consistently using an intuitive set of assumptions.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the three-dimensional structure of Galactic molecular clouds is important for understanding how clouds are affected by processes such as turbulence and magnetic fields and how this structure effects star formation within them. Great progress has been made in this field with the arrival of the Gaia mission, which provides accurate distances to \${\textbackslash}sim10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}\$ stars. Combining these distances with extinctions inferred from optical-IR, we recover the three-dimensional structure of 16 Galactic molecular cloud complexes at \${\textbackslash}sim1\$pc resolution using our novel three-dimensional dust mapping algorithm {\textbackslash}texttt\{Dustribution\}. Using {\textbackslash}texttt\{astrodendro\} we derive a catalogue of physical parameters for each complex. We recover structures with aspect ratios between 1 and 11, i.e.{\textbackslash} everything from near-spherical to very elongated shapes. We find a large variation in cloud environments that is not apparent when studying them in two-dimensions. For example, the nearby California and Orion A clouds look similar on-sky, but we find California to be more sheet-like, and massive, which could explain their different star-formation rates. In Carina, our most distant complex, we observe evidence for dust sputtering, which explains its measured low dust mass. By calculating the total mass of these individual clouds, we demonstrate that it is necessary to define cloud boundaries in three-dimensions in order to obtain an accurate mass; simply integrating the extinction overestimates masses. We find that Larson's relationship on mass vs radius holds true whether you assume a spherical shape for the cloud or take their true extents.},
